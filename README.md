# Face Recognition Project
Microsoft Intern Engage Mentorship Program 2022 Project

## Project Description
This project is a face recognition-based entry system. It is designed to manage the entry of people in the event. It helps ensure security by allowing only registered users to enter through the entry gate. At the same time it also marks the attendance of the users, thus providing real-time attendance tracking. New users can register themselves by filling the registration form where they are required to capture their image for face recognition.
